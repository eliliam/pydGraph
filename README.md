### pydGraph

pydGraph is a library created to work with graphs as easily as possible, it allows users to build their own graphs
without much overhead and enables users to apply different algorithms to their graphs. This library was created using
the networkx library as a baseplate, allowing users to call those functions on the graph as well.
